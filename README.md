## Function App Deployment
The Function App assembly/code has to be deployed from your local machine by running [deploy-function.ps1](./deploy/deploy-function.ps1) and providing the following parameters.

|Name|Mandatory|Description|Default|
|-|-|-|-|
|functionAppName|No|Name of the currently deployed Function App||
|environmentUrl|Yes|URL of your Power Apps Environment e.g. https://org.crm.dynamics.com||
|createApplicationUser|No|Create the Managed Identity of the Function App as an Application User in the Power Apps Environment|$false|

You also do it all in once (create Azure resources and deploy the Function App code) by running [run.ps1](./deploy/run.ps1) and providing the following parameters

|Name|Mandatory|Description|Default|
|-|-|-|-|
|resourceGroup|No|Name of the new Resource Group where you would like the resources deployed to|rgazfunc|
|location|No|Azure location where you would like the Resource Group to be created in. For a complete list of locations you can use run ```Connect-AzAccount``` then ```Get-AzLocation \| Format-Table``` in powershell.|australiasoutheast|
|environmentUrl|Yes|URL of your Power Apps Environment e.g. https://org.crm.dynamics.com||
|createApplicationUser|No|Create the Managed Identity of the Function App as an Application User in the Power Apps Environment|$false|

The created Application User needs to have the right security roles assigned, so that operations in the Function App that leverage Power Apps WebAPI can be performed.
